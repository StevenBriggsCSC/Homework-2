# Homework-2
The included test document is just Frankenstein and it's what i used for the file manipulation.

On part A I lost points for a syntax and logic error.

On part C I lost for points for forgetting to sort the list before writing to file.

I didn't lose points anywhere else so i guess the rest is fine.
